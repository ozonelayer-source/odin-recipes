    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Pork barbecue in bamboo skewers is what Filipino Style Pork BBQ is all about. It is composed of thinly sliced pork pieces that are marinated in a special mixture of seasonings and spices. In the Philippines, it is normally grilled over wood charcoal and dipped in a tall jar of spicy vinegar before eating.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs. pork shoulder sliced into thin pieces</li>
        <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup juice extracted from calamansi or lemon</li>
        <li>¾ cup banana ketchup</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups lemon or lime soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the pork slices in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add all the marinade ingredients. Mix well. Cover the bowl and marinate for at least 3 hours. Note: I strongly suggest marinating overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Fasten the marinated pork together using bamboo skewers.</li>
        <li>Heat-up the grill. Start to grill your Filipino Style pork BBQ for 3 to 5 minutes per side until the meat is thoroughly cooked. Make sure to always baste the BBQ when flipping it over. Note: the basting sauce ingredients are the same as the marinade ingredients minus the lemon soda.</li>
        <li>Serve with spicy vinegar.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
